twenty4

Javascript based countdown timer.

The original idea I found was from <a href="http://codecanyon.net/item/jbmarket-circular-countdown/3100472?ref=lvraa" target="_blank">JBMarket</a>.

I just wanted to try doing it myself, and perhaps making it more extensible and plugin-ish.

Uses &lt;canvas&gt; so supports IE9+.
